### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Mark, and Iâ€™m an engineering team lead and software engineer with over 13+ years of experience in building software intensive systems. My past tenures range from startups/scale-ups to Fortune 500 MNCs, where I have traveled to and worked out of amazing locations in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, and Norway. My work and contributions have primarily been in enterprise ecosystems, event driven systems, actor based frameworks, event sourcing, domain driven design, databases (migrations, performance tuning, analytics, reporting), and solution architecture activities. More recently, I have been leading engineering teams in building products and features that a.) are aligned with business north star metrics, b.) drive business growth/scale, and c.) move the needle on CES/CSAT/NPS quality metrics.
