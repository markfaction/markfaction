### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark, a seasoned developer and engineering lead with over 16 years of experience. I currently specialize in tools and automation, with a focus on enterprise architecture. In previous roles, I have worn the hat of a developer, technical consultant, people manager, cloud platform engineer, and DevOps engineer. My work has taken me across startups, scaleups, and fortune 500's, spanning locations in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand (my current home base). Occasionally, I share insights and observations from my professional and personal life [on my blog](https://markfaction.github.io/).
