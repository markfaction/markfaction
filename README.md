### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Mark, and Iâ€™m a senior tech lead with over a decade of experience in the software industry. Throughout my career, I have been coding, mentoring, and driving tech innovation, in collaboration with various teams and individuals around the globe. My past tenures over the last ten years have taken me across organizations ranging from startups to Fortune 500 multinationals, travelling to and working from Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, and Norway. My contributions have primarily been in the areas of full stack web development, distributed systems, actor frameworks, reactive systems, event-sourcing, domain driven design, and solution architecture.

I currently work as an engineering team lead at [:Different](https://different.com.au/), an Australian based startup that is radically redefining property management and home assistance automation. The :Different team consists of an insanely smart group of individuals (including senior alumni from Google, Uber, Sysco LABS, ThoughtWorks, and the Boston Consulting Group) who excel at entrepreneurship, startup engineering, cutting edge tech adoption/practices, data driven thinking, and fostering an amazing culture of continuous learning.
