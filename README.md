### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Mark, and Iâ€™m a developer and engineering lead with over 16+ years of experience. I have been a developer, people manager, Cloud/DevOps/Platform engineer, and now my focus is towards tools + automation within the enterprise architecture space. I have worked in many cross-functional engineering roles across startups, scaleups, and fortune 500's, spanning work locations in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand. Occasionally, I post articles [on my blog](https://markfaction.github.io/) that touch upon interesting lessons + observations from my work and personal life.
