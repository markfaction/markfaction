### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Mark, and I am an engineering team lead and software engineer with over 13+ years of experience in building software intensive systems. My past tenures range from startups/scale-ups to Fortune 500 MNCs, where I have travelled to and worked from amazing locations in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, and Norway. My work and contributions have primarily been in enterprise ecosystems, event driven systems, actor frameworks, event sourcing, domain driven design, databases (migrations, performance tuning, analytics), and in solution architecture activities. More recently, I have been leading multiple engineering teams in building products and features that are aligned with business north star metrics, which drive business growth/scale, and move the needle on CES/CSAT/NPS quality metrics.
