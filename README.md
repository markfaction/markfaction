### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Mark, and Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 13+ years of experience in building software intensive systems. My past tenures range from startups/scale-ups to Fortune 500 MNCs, where I have travelled to and worked out of amazing locations in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Japan, and Norway. My work and contributions have primarily been in enterprise ecosystems, event driven systems, actor based frameworks + event sourcing, domain driven design, databases (migrations, perf tuning, analytics), and engaging in solution architecture activities.
